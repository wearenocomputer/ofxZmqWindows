# ofxZmqWindows
a port of the ofxZmq add-on for Windows: https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxZmq

The library is compiled with VS2015 for 32 and 64 bit systems.

For creating a project, you can use the openFrameworks project generator.
Before running a project, manually copy the appropriate dll files (32/64 bit) into the bin directory.

If anybody figures out how to use the static libraries, please feel free to share :-)

Tested on Windows10/Visual Studio 2015/oF0.9.8
